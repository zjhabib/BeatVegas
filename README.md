## Sports-betting Industry

> The gambling industry has been ever-growing ever since legal sportsbetting came to fruition. One type of bet that many people take is a proposition bet, meaning how likely or not is this proposed bet going to hit. The proposition bet I am going to target specifically is how many points will Player X score, and what variables from the data provided seem to make the biggest difference. I have found a data set on kaggle that provides 2 csv files for the historical information on each game for Michael Jordan and Lebron James. I will be focusing on Lebron James as the player is still active allowing me to predict future scoring numbers. I am looking as well to see if I can merge historical data sets of those specific games that are specific to sports-betting that have variables that can also affect scoring output

**Possible Areas to Examine**

- How does the team you are playing affect scoring output?
- How does the over/under on the amount of points estimated to be scored in the game affect you are playing affect scoring output?
- How does the minutes played affect scoring output?
- How does Fieid Goal % affect scoring output?
- How does 3 point % affect scoring output?
- How does Free throw % affect scoring output?
- How does plus/minus affect scoring output?
