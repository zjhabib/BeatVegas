## Sports-betting Industry

> The gambling industry has been ever-growing ever since legal sportsbetting came to fruition. One type of bet that many people take is a proposition bet, meaning how likely or not is this proposed bet going to hit. The proposition bet I am going to target specifically is how likely is it that Player X will cover the proposed QB bet (completions) and what variables that we know beforehand like spread, over/under, weather make an impact. I have found a data set on kaggle that provides historical betting information on each game. I then merged prop bet information on those specific games.

**Possible Areas to Examine**

- How does the team you are playing affect whether a player is going to cover a bet?
- How does the over/under on the amount of points estimated to be scored in the game affect whether a player is going to cover a bet?
- How does Home/Away affect whether a player is going to cover a bet?
- How does career averages affect whether a player is going to cover a bet?
